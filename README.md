# App Management Lifecycle

There is a lifecycle to app management, consisting of five key stages: Add, Deploy, Configure, Protect, and Retire.

## Add
This phase enables the addition of applications from various sources, including:
- App store
- Line-of-business AKA In-house developments
- Built-in apps
- Web-based apps

## Deploy
In this phase, you assign the app to users and devices, which can be monitored within the Azure portal. The Intune administration console also provides the ability to track license usage for apps that require licenses in bulk.

## Configure

Intune and Configuration Manager provide methods to configure app installation and updates.

- Managed browser policies allow you to configure settings and restrict websites that your users can visit.
- Specific settings for Microsoft Outlook can be configured upon installation.
- Configuring user and system contexts in apps helps detect whether the app is installed or needs to be updated. 

You can even specify the sope of the app configurations as well as group together users/devices and all them to either be Required, Available for enrolled devices or just Uninstall. 

### Eliminating App Setup Problems!

- With the addition of App configuration policies, policies are assigned to end users before running a specific app. Because the settings are unique to each app, end users don't need to take action, and the settings will be applied automatically.

- Configuration policies can be used for iOS/iPadOS or Android apps.

- Any of the following details can be specified for configuration settings:
  - Custom port numbers, language, security settings, branding such as logos.

This protects against the incorrect configuration of settings for apps and allows for smooth running for end users and everyone else!

## Protect

This phase involves implementing policies to safeguard apps, including data leak prevention for apps specific to certain operating systems and app-specific protection policies.

- **Conditional Access**: This feature controls access to email and services based on conditions you specify, such as device types or compliance with deployed policies.

- **App Protection Policies**: These policies work with individual apps to enhance the protection of company data. They restrict data copying between unmanaged and managed apps, and also provide the capability to prevent the operation of jailbroken or rooted devices.

## Enterprise Enhanced Data Protection (Level 2)

Recommended as a standard for devices accessing sensitive information, this level builds upon Level 1 by:

- **Minimum OS Version Requirement:** Requires a minimum OS version for enhanced security.
- **Data Transfer Restrictions:** Restricts data transfers to enhance protection.

## Enterprise High Data Protection (Level 3)

Recommended for organizations with sophisticated security needs or those targeted by adversaries, Level 3 introduces:

- **Further Data Transfer Restrictions:** Adds additional restrictions on data transfer scenarios.
- **Increased PIN Configuration Complexity:** Enhances the complexity of PIN configurations.
- **Mobile Threat Detection:** Includes the addition of mobile threat detection for advanced security.

For detailed policy settings for each framework level, refer to the official documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-framework#level-1-enterprise-basic-data-protection).


## Retire
Apps that are outdated and need to be removed can be uninstalled by assigining an **uninstall intent** to a group of users or devices. 

To delete an app in Configuration Manager:
- You delete an app by first retiring the app. 
- Delete all deploymenets of the app and references to the app by other deployments.
- Finally, delete all app's revisions.
