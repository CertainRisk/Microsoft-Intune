## Integration:

Intune seamlessly integrates with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Endpoint analytics, and Windows Autopilot. This synergy establishes a powerful management infrastructure, enabling organizations to provide IT services, apps, protection, and configurations, maximizing end-user productivity.

By implementing Microsoft Intune, organizations can create a secure and productive digital environment, offering a range of services and protections for end users. This journey into Microsoft Intune unfolds the potential for streamlined device management, enhanced productivity, and robust data security.

## Protecting Endpoint Environments with Microsoft Intune

The Microsoft Intune Admin Center is where you can configure settings for devices, apps, and users to better protect them. It allows for the creation of Configuration Profiles for specific platforms and devices to streamline management.

### Examples of Device Configuration Policies:

- **Restricting Hardware Features:** Control the use of device features like the camera or Bluetooth.
- **Passcode Resets:** Reset passcodes for users facing device lockouts.
- **Compliance Requirements:** Enforce protection standards, such as PIN usage, for device compliance.
- **App Configuration:** Manage compliant and noncompliant apps with alerts and potential installation blocks.
- **App and Data Protection:** Safeguard apps and the data they handle.
- **Identity-based Protection:** Add an extra layer of protection to devices based on user identity.
- **Windows Hello for Business:** Control settings for this alternative sign-in method on Windows 10 and later.
- **Device Retirement:** Securely retire devices and remove associated data.
- **Email Configuration:** Allow seamless access to company email on personal devices without additional setup.


## Protecting and Managing Applications

Intune MAM supports two different configurations: Mobile Device Management (MDM) & Mobile App Management (MAM).

### Mobile App Management (MAM)

IT Admins can manage apps using MAM on devices currently enrolled with Intune MDM. MAM without device enrollment, also known as MAM-WE, allows IT Admins to manage apps using MAM and app protection on devices not enrolled with Intune MDM.

Intune allows for a wide range of app control that can easily be pushed across all devices and users. Examples of some app policies are as follows:

- **Add and Assign Apps:** Seamlessly add and assign apps to devices and users for a tailored experience.
- **Assign Apps to Non-Enrolled Devices:** Extend app assignment even to devices not enrolled with Intune, ensuring flexibility.
- **App-Configuration Policies:** Fine-tune app behavior with configuration policies, gaining control over startup actions.
- **Data Protection:** Safeguard sensitive data by preventing backup from protected apps.
- **Copy and Paste Restrictions:** Enhance security by restricting copy and paste actions between apps.
- **PIN Access Requirement:** Strengthen app security by requiring a PIN for access.

## Provisioning

### Windows Devices:

Windows Autopilot can be used for device provisioning, offering four deployment modes, including Self-Deploying Mode for shared devices and User-Driven Mode for traditional users. Autopilot ensures easy deployment for the latest Windows versions. White Glove facilitates pre-provisioning by partners or IT staff.

### Alternative Windows Provisioning:

Configuration Manager provides diverse methods for deploying Windows OS, from Software Center to PXE. Intune also supports bulk enrollment for Microsoft Entra tenants.

### Apple Devices:

Use Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager for iOS and macOS provisioning. Set up Intune to enroll Apple devices through Automated Device Enrollment, allowing you to streamline large-scale enrollment.

### Android Devices:

Use the Android Enterprise zero-touch program to provision corporate-owned devices. Zero-touch allows mass provisioning and enrollment without physical contact.

## App Management with Intune

Intune can help manage the apps that a company's workforce uses on devices using Mobile Application Management (MAM).
