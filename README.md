# App Management Lifecycle

There is a lifecycle to app management, consisting of five key stages: Add, Deploy, Configure, Protect, and Retire.

## Add
This phase enables the addition of applications from various sources, including:
- App store
- Line-of-business AKA In-house developments
- Built-in apps
- Web-based apps
![image](https://github.com/CertainRisk/Microsoft-Intune/assets/141761181/82491633-eb5f-4d89-ab92-8856fb74d0ec)
![image](https://github.com/CertainRisk/Microsoft-Intune/assets/141761181/ce50b469-a283-4f35-9d2b-08ee4187ce85)

## Deploy
In this phase, you assign the app to users and devices, which can be monitored within the Azure portal. The Intune administration console also provides the ability to track license usage for apps that require licenses in bulk.

## Configure

Intune and Configuration Manager provide methods to configure app installation and updates.

- Managed browser policies allow you to configure settings and restrict websites that your users can visit.
- Specific settings for Microsoft Outlook can be configured upon installation.
- Configuring user and system contexts in apps helps detect whether the app is installed or needs to be updated. 

You can even specify the sope of the app configurations as well as group together users/devices and all them to either be Required, Available for enrolled devices or just Uninstall. 

### Eliminating App Setup Problems!

- With the addition of App configuration policies, policies are assigned to end users before running a specific app. Because the settings are unique to each app, end users don't need to take action, and the settings will be applied automatically.

- Configuration policies can be used for iOS/iPadOS or Android apps.

- Any of the following details can be specified for configuration settings:
  - Custom port numbers, language, security settings, branding such as logos.

This protects against the incorrect configuration of settings for apps and allows for smooth running for end users and everyone else!

## Protect

This phase involves implementing policies to safeguard apps, including data leak prevention for apps specific to certain operating systems and app-specific protection policies.

- **Conditional Access**: This feature controls access to email and services based on conditions you specify, such as device types or compliance with deployed policies.

- **App Protection Policies**: These policies work with individual apps to enhance the protection of company data. They restrict data copying between unmanaged and managed apps, and also provide the capability to prevent the operation of jailbroken or rooted devices.

## Retire
Apps that are outdated and need to be removed can be uninstalled by assigining an **uninstall intent** to a group of users or devices. 

To delete an app in Configuration Manager:
- You delete an app by first retiring the app. 
- Delete all deploymenets of the app and references to the app by other deployments.
- Finally, delete all app's revisions.


# Conditional Access and Endpoint Security in Intune

Conditional Access is a Microsoft Entra capability (for ID P1 and P2 licenses), Intune adds to this capability by adding mobile device compliance and MAM to the mix. 

In Intune, groups are used in applying policies, such as Conditional Access and endpoint security.

**Conditional Access Policies:** Govern access to resources like email, files, and data. They ensure that only trusted users on trusted devices using trusted apps can access these resources.

**Endpoint Security Policies:** Offer vital security measures for your organization's devices.

Conditional Access provides granular access control to gate access to your data based on location, devices, user state and application sensitivity. 

Intune provides different types of Conditional Access:

**Device Based Conditional Access**
 - Conditional Access for Exchange on-premises, Windows PCs (Corporate Owned and BYOD)
 - Conditional Access based on network access control.
 - Conditional Access based on device risk. 

**App-based Conditional Access**

## Conditional Access with Co-Management

I) Intune evaluates every device in your network to determine its level of trustworthiness.
- It ensures devices are securely configured; this evaluation is pre-security breach and configuration-based.
- Configuration Manager also conducts an evaluation on required updates or app compliance.

II) Intune can detect active security incidents on devices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and other mobile threat-defense providers.
- They run ongoing behavioral analysis on devices, identifying active incidents.
- This evaluation is post-security breach and incident-based.
- 
## Device Based Conditional Access

Intune and Microsoft Entra ID collaborate to allow access to email, Office 365 services, Software as a Service (SaaS) apps, and on-premises apps only for managed and compliant devices. You can configure a policy in Microsoft Entra ID to restrict access to Office 365 services exclusively for domain-joined computers or mobile devices enrolled in Intune.

Intune offers device compliance policy capabilities to assess the compliance status of devices. The compliance status is reported to Microsoft Entra ID, which utilizes it to enforce the Conditional Access policy established in Microsoft Entra ID when a user attempts to access company resources.

TL;DR Intune and Entra ID work in tandem to ensure that only compliant devices can access email, 365 services, SaaS apps, etc. Compliance status, as reported by Intune, is used by Entra ID to enforce Conditional Access policies.

## Network Access Control Conditional Access

Intune teams up with partners like Cisco ISE, Aruba Clear Pass, and Citrix NetScaler for smart access controls. This means users get access or denial to corporate Wi-Fi or VPN based on whether their device is both managed and compliant with Intune's policies.

## Device Risk Conditional Access

Intune teams up with Mobile Threat Defense partners for strong security against malware, Trojans, and other threats on mobile devices.

**How it works:**
- When the Mobile Threat Defense agent is on a mobile device, it sends messages to Intune about its compliance status, especially when a threat is detected.

## Windows PC-based Conditional Access

**Corporate-Owned**
  - *Microsoft Entra Hybrid Joined*: Companies comfortable with managing PCs through AD policies or Configuration Manager choose this option.
  - *Microsoft Entra Domain Joined*: Cloud-first or Cloud-only organizations allowing access to both cloud and on-premises apps and resources.

**BYOD**
- *Workplace Join and Intune Management*: Users bring their own device and access corporate resources with it. Workplace join is used to enroll devices into the Intune MDM and receive device-level policies.


# Group-Based Policy Management

**Assigned Groups** - Manually add users and devices to a static group.

**Dynamic Groups** - Automatically add users and devices to user or device groups based on an expression.
  - Dynamic Groups require Entra ID P1 or P2.

Device categories can be created to automatically add devices to groups based on predetermined rules.
- Different groups can be available for users to choose from during enrollment.
- iPhone/iPad and Android device users have to select a group during setup, while for Windows, this can be done through the Company Portal.
- Once devices are in groups, rules and apps can be assigned to them.
