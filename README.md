# Protecting Endpoint Environments with Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune Admin Center is where you can configure settings for devices, apps and users to better protect them. 

Intune allows for Configuration Profiles to be made for specific plaforms and devices in order to make things more streamlined. 

## Examples of Device Configuration Policies

Intune configuration policies provide granular control over device settings. Examples include:

- **Restricting Hardware Features:** Control the use of device features like the camera or Bluetooth.
- **Passcode Resets:** Reset passcodes for users facing device lockouts.
- **Compliance Requirements:** Enforce protection standards, such as PIN usage, for device compliance.
- **App Configuration:** Manage compliant and noncompliant apps, with alerts and potential installation blocks.
- **App and Data Protection:** Safeguard apps and the data they handle.
- **Identity-based Protection:** Add an extra layer of protection to devices based on user identity.
- **Windows Hello for Business:** Control settings for this alternative sign-in method on Windows 10 and later.
- **Device Retirement:** Securely retire devices and remove associated data.
- **Email Configuration:** Allow seamless access to company email on personal devices without additional setup.

# Protecting and Managing Applications.

Intune MAM supports two different configurations:
**Mobile Device Management (MDM) & Mobile App Management (MAM)**
- IT Admins can only manage apps using MAM on devices currently enrolled with Intune MDM.

**Mobile App Management (MAM)**
- MAM without device enrollment, also known as MAM-WE will allow IT Admins to manage apps using MAM and app protection on devices not enrolled with Intune MDM. 

Intune allows for a wide range of app control that can easily be pushed across all devices and users. Examples of some app policies are as follows:
1. **Add and Assign Apps:**
   - Seamlessly add and assign apps to devices and users for a tailored experience.

2. **Assign Apps to Non-Enrolled Devices:**
   - Extend app assignment even to devices not enrolled with Intune, ensuring flexibility.

3. **App-Configuration Policies:**
   - Fine-tune app behavior with configuration policies, gaining control over startup actions.

4. **Data Protection:**
   - Safeguard sensitive data by preventing backup from protected apps.

5. **Copy and Paste Restrictions:**
   - Enhance security by restricting copy and paste actions between apps.

6. **PIN Access Requirement:**
   - Strengthen app security by requiring a PIN for access.
